            <h2>What is Vibe Coding?</h2>
            <p>Vibe coding is an emerging software development practice that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate functional code from natural language prompts. This approach accelerates development and makes app building more accessible, especially for those with limited programming experience. The developer focuses on iterative experimentation and providing high-level guidance, rather than micromanaging the code.</p>

        <section id="core-concepts">
            <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Prompts:</strong> Describe your goals in plain English, and let the AI translate your vision into code.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Refinement:</strong> Start with a simple idea, then progressively add complexity and features through conversation with the AI.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on the "What," not the "How":</strong> Concentrate on the desired outcome and let the AI handle the implementation details.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration:</strong> Vibe coding is a partnership. The human provides the creative vision, while the AI provides the technical execution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits of Vibe Coding</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Generate code in a fraction of the time it would take to write it manually.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Barrier to Entry:</strong> Build software with minimal coding knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Creativity:</strong> Focus on high-level ideas and experiment with new concepts without getting bogged down in syntax.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> Quickly create working prototypes to test and validate your ideas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Be Clear and Specific:</strong> The more detailed your prompt, the better the AI will understand your intent.</li>
                <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Don't try to build a complex application all at once. Begin with a small, manageable feature and build from there.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide Feedback:</strong> If the generated code isn't quite right, tell the AI what you'd like to change.</li>
                <li><strong>Review and Test:</strong> Always review the generated code to ensure it meets your requirements and is free of errors.</li>
            </ol>

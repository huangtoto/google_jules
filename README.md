# Vibe Coding Website

This is a simple, static website created to introduce the concept of "Vibe Coding." It includes a description of what Vibe Coding is, its core concepts, benefits, and best practices. It also features an interactive demo that simulates the experience of generating code from natural language prompts.

## How to Run Locally

To run this website locally, you don't need any special tools or servers. Simply follow these steps:

1.  **Download the files:** Make sure you have all the files in the same directory:
    *   `index.html`
    *   `style.css`
    *   `script.js`

2.  **Open in your browser:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with...".

That's it! The website should now be running locally in your browser.

## How to Deploy

This website is a "static site," which means it consists of only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This makes it very easy to deploy to a variety of free hosting services. Here are a few popular options:

### GitHub Pages

1.  **Create a GitHub repository:** If you don't already have one, create a new repository on GitHub.
2.  **Push the files:** Add the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files to your repository and push them to GitHub.
3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:** In your repository's settings, go to the "Pages" section and select the branch you want to deploy from (usually `main`).
4.  **Visit your site:** GitHub will provide you with a URL where your website is now live (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`).

### Netlify

1.  **Sign up for Netlify:** Create a free account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2.  **Drag and drop:** You can simply drag the folder containing your website files directly onto the Netlify dashboard to deploy it.
3.  **Connect to Git:** Alternatively, you can connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for automatic deployments whenever you push changes.

### Vercel

1.  **Sign up for Vercel:** Create a free account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2.  **Import your project:** You can import your project directly from a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
3.  **Deploy:** Vercel will automatically detect that it's a static site and deploy it for you.

By following these instructions, you can easily share your Vibe Coding website with the world!
